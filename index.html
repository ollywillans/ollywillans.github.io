    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Stone, Muted Teal, Soft Gold) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard application with three main interactive sections: 1) Key Themes Dashboard for a high-level overview and sentiment analysis including contradictions, 2) Interactive Feedback Explorer to filter and drill-down into comments by question and reviewer, and 3) Actionable Roadmap of Proposed Changes, filterable by priority. This structure was chosen to transform the dense, linear report into a user-driven, explorable experience, allowing users to move from summary to detail at their own pace, which is more effective for synthesis and decision-making than a simple document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
    - Key Themes: Goal: Inform/Summarize. Method: HTML/CSS cards + Chart.js Donut Chart (Sentiment). Interaction: Hover effects on cards. Justification: Provides a quick, visual entry point to the aggregated feedback.
    - Feedback Explorer: Goal: Organize/Compare. Method: HTML/CSS cards with JS filtering. Interaction: Dropdown/button filters. Justification: Enables targeted exploration of individual comments by question and reviewer for deeper understanding.
    - Proposed Changes: Goal: Organize/Prioritize. Method: Filterable HTML/CSS list. Interaction: Priority filters. Justification: Transforms the analytical output into an actionable roadmap for document revision.
    - Contradictions: Goal: Highlight/Inform. Method: Dedicated HTML/CSS card. Justification: Draws immediate attention to critical discussion points.
    - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p class="text-stone-600 text-sm mb-3">A central tension exists in how co-owners perceive the document's ability to inspire and engage:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-stone-600 space-y-1">
                                <li>**Iona T-D.:** "Unfortunately I don't find it inspiring. It is dry and feels like reading a contract... very corporate... at the cost of feeling inhuman."</li>
                                <li>**Sam T.:** "Yes, it helps me feel connected to the bigger picture... The constitution will also offer a stable foundation for everyone should times become more challenging in the future." / "Yes, it is encouraging and inspiring."</li>
                                <li>**Alex M.:** "It does [inspire], because it brings together the essence of how we are structured." / "It's unambiguous yet approachable; I like it."</li>

                            <p class="text-stone-600 text-sm mt-3">**Implication:** Maciej's positive feedback strengthens the 'inspiring' side, reinforcing the crucial balance between legal precision and cultural resonance. Supplementary materials may be key to addressing this.</p>

                            <p class="text-stone-600 text-sm mb-3">While the Constitution clarifies *current* decision-making, the introduction's reference to the initial EOT decision has differing impacts:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-stone-600 space-y-1">
                                <li>**Iona T-D.:** "The opening line 'In 2019, we chose a bold path...' made me question who is making the decisions. Speaking personally, at the time I didn't feel like it was a decision that I was part of."</li>
                                <li>**Alex M.:** "Yes, the intention to clarify situations like last year's redundancies is clear and welcome." (Implies current clarity is appreciated, even if past decision-making was different).</li>

                            <p class="text-stone-600 text-sm mt-3">**Implication:** This highlights the importance of historical context vs. current state. The intro could acknowledge the journey more explicitly without re-litigating the past. This is less of a direct contradiction on the *document's content* and more about *user experience/perception* influenced by past events.</p>

Hopefully most people who apply for a job at Torchbox value the fact that the company is focusing on the tech for good sector - helping charities and non-profits. I know that I did. It's good to see that not only those values are aligned between myself and the company, but also that the company itself is quite transparent and takes care of its employees." },

As it's not mentioned before, it may come as a 'surprise'... perhaps introducing it briefly earlier on could be beneficial." },
                    { id: 49, questionId: 4, reviewer: 'Maciej B.', type: 'Suggestion', comment: "Another thing which is perhaps missing is what could be done about issues which commonly plague companies which is 'company politics': how to avoid the formation of 'cliques' and how less outspoken and more timid people are encouraged to participate and voice their opinions and concerns. I know that we have Voice Groups and such, but I think a sentence or paragraph acknowledging could go a long way." },

But I think the description of our purpose... isn't very accessible to an outsider... it's hard to understand as an outsider and could be offputting. The social impact section does a good job of explaining it, but I wonder if if could be introduced earlier." },

I think the existence of a constitution shows a desire for transparency within the organisation." },

                    { id: 50, questionId: 5, reviewer: 'Maciej B.', type: 'Positive', comment: "Yes. I think that a model which focus on the employee and working towards improving society as a whole is an attractive proposition. People who look for new jobs may be especially disheartened or disappointed about their current companies, and the feeling of having more control and influence over the company would definitely be something someone looking for a new place to work at would value." },

It makes me feel that if I have any issues or concerns, I will be listened to, and that it is easier for me compared to a regular company to raise those concerns and initiate change. In general I think this is something that increases morale and makes people stay longer at companies." },

                    { id: 30, questionId: 7, reviewer: 'Sam T.', type: 'Improvement', comment: "This document does make this clear, however, as stated in my feedback on the document, I think we need to make it clearer who is making the decisions when things perhaps are not going so well within the organisation. Eg redundancies. I want to understand more about when I will be consulted/informed as a co-owner and when that isn't appropriate and why." },
                    { id: 31, questionId: 7, reviewer: 'Iona T-D.', type: 'Improvement', comment: "The opening line 'In 2019, we chose a bold path, becoming employee-owned' made me question who is making the decisions. Speaking personally, at the time I didn't feel like it was a decision that I was part of... For the structure and governance section it would be really helpful to have an organogram or other visualisation. The responsibilities of the board of directors and SLT are listed as bullet points, could we get a similar list for the trust board? It would be good to include an explanation of who is on the trust board, board of directors, and SLT." },

                    { id: 52, questionId: 7, reviewer: 'Maciej B.', type: 'Improvement', comment: "I think this is fairly well explained, but additional examples as I mentioned earlier could help placing everything more in context. Your average person will not have any experience working at an employee-owned company, and thus it might be even difficult for them to imagine what this involves. Some people might see the Trust as yet another entity in the hierarchy of the company which is inaccessible. By reiterating that we all have opportunities to influence decisions and raise concerns, we can make sure that people understand that the structure of the company is somewhat 'flatter' than your usual company, even if not everyone has an equal say." },

                    { id: 35, questionId: 8, reviewer: 'Iona T-D.', type: 'Improvement', comment: "The tone of voice is very corporate. It gives weight and clarity to the content, but at the cost of feeling inhuman. I think it's the lists of actions and adjectives that I find off putting. Combining them all together makes them feel less meaningful... There were some specific phrases in our constitution that gave me pause: 'As a digital agency, we must constantly evolve to thrive' - isn't this true of every business? 'We assess the organisation and the project, with public good as our benchmark.' - how do we define public good? What if the organisation only helps a small section of the public? 'The Trust Board must maintain a gender balance (or a gender imbalance, where it is the opposite gender balance to the company board).' - I'm not sure what this means. 'Co-owners are expected to: 4.1 Contribute to work that enables social, environmental or public benefit... 4.2 Understand the goals behind our work...' 4.1 and 4.2 sound almost the same, could they be combined?" },
                    { id: 36, questionId: 8, reviewer: 'Alex M.', type: 'Positive', comment: "It's unambiguous yet approachable; I like it. As an aside, I've been continually impressed by the writing style on the Intranet, and I feel this is in line with all that." },
                    { id: 37, questionId: 8, reviewer: 'Sam T.', type: 'Positive', comment: "The language is simple and clear. Sentences are short and structured in a way that is easy to absorb. I have no comment on the improvement of this as I think you have got it right." },
                    { id: 38, questionId: 8, reviewer: 'Helen C.', type: 'Improvement', comment: "Mostly great - as I said in a previous comment I think we could make the introduction more personal and engaging." },
                    { id: 53, questionId: 8, reviewer: 'Maciej B.', type: 'Improvement', comment: "This is just a minor point regarding language, but we often mix 'we', 'you' and 'them' (co-owners). For instance, we have a section that says 'As co-owners, we have the right to:' which is nice but then later 'co-owners are expected to' (...) 'share your opinion'. I think using the collective we can be more powerful, but this is a personal preference." },

I think it's unlikely that most employees will read the whole text. My instinct would be to throw it into ChatGPT. Creating a members' guide like the example shared for Scott Bader, with a lot of visual interest and more casual tone, would be more accessible and would allow us to have more say in the presentation than relying on people's ability to use Al assistance. When creating accompanying materials I'd recommend including: Names and faces of key decision makers. Examples of the principles in action. Examples of changes we have made that have come from outside of senior leadership eg. voice group initiatives." },

I think it's healthy to see contentious issues being discussed - it normalizes the fact that there are different opinions and passions. It also provides an example to all co-owners, showing how they can try to get their own issues resolved, aside from complaining or asking nicely." },

I think it's a strong document as it is but there's potential to tighten it even further and make it a real cornerstone of the next 25 years of Torchbox, so it's great to be a part of that process." },
                    { id: 54, questionId: 9, reviewer: 'Maciej B.', type: 'Suggestion', comment: "It might be a good idea to share this draft with someone from outside of Torchbox who does not know what an employee-owned business is. It's sometimes difficult to not take some things for granted, and easy to miss things or not explain them early enough. Most of the questions included in this document would be good to include when asking an outsider about the constitution." },

There might be ways of introducing those within the text of the constitution but I do understand that perhaps this document is a bit more 'official', and such examples might be better suited elsewhere. Nonetheless I think it would be worth discussing, or finding alternative ways to make things feel more 'relatable'." },
